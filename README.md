This is a final project of another Udacity's course (https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197) “Intro to Relational Databases”. In this project I wrote PostgreSQL database and python module that uses this database to keep track of players and their statistics in a game tournament. It uses some input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and sanitization (by bleach module) to prevent script injection attack. Look for technical specifications in project_description.md file. I used git while writing this.
